  - header: Story
    text: Caldera Interactive was created in 2018 when Jeff Cho sought out fellow University of Alberta graduates, Isael Huard, Mickael Zerihoun and Titus Lo, to found a part-time game studio together. All individuals on the team were hand-picked for their passion and care for the gaming industry, as well as their diverse skill sets that complement each otherâ€™s. Caldera Interactive was officially incorporated in 2019 and Isael, Mickael and Titus started full-time operations of the studio in 2022. Since then, the team has worked on multiple prototypes that received over $1.5 million CAD from the Canada Media Fund and other funding bodies. The team also won the GDC Pitch competition in 2024 for their game, The Rabbit Haul, set to release in 2026.
